# Common ICON Output Format

To ensure that ICONEval works smoothly, the ICON simulation output should
follow the subsequent criteria as closely as possible. An example ICON-A run
script that produces output which follows this standard can be found
[here](../icon_run/exp.example_for_iconeval.run).

To check if your output contains all necessary variables, you can use the
recipe template
[`recipe_check_data_availability.yml`](https://github.com/EyringMLClimateGroup/ICONEval/tree/main/iconeval/more_recipe_templates/recipe_check_data_availability.yml),
e.g.,

```bash
iconeval path/to/ICON_output --recipe_templates=/path/to/ICONEval/iconeval/more_recipe_templates/recipe_check_data_availability.yml
```

## Output Frequency

- Most diagnostics are tailored towards **monthly mean** data, but should in
  principle work with higher frequency output (this might take longer, though).
- Some diagnostics require sub-daily (preferably **1-hourly**) output.
- Sub-hourly output is **not** supported at the moment.
- The output should contain **averaged** quantities, not **instantaneous**
  values.

## File Naming

The output files should follow one of the following naming conventions:

- `{exp}/{exp}_{var_type}*.nc`
- `{exp}/outdata/{exp}_{var_type}*.nc`

`{exp}` corresponds to the name of your experiment, and `{var_type}` to the
type of the output variable (namelist; e.g., `atm_2d_ml`).

If possible, one file should contain one simulated year. Less than that is fine
(e.g., one file per time step) but makes the evaluation slower; more than that
(e.g., one file per 5 years) is **not** supported at the moment.

## Simulation Period

- If possible, at least 20 years should be simulated. This enables a meaningful
  comparison to reference data like observations.
- Usually, simulations start in 1979. This might be problematic, since most
  satellite observations are only available for later years. Thus, the starting
  year might change to a later year in the future.
- Simulations should not start earlier than 1979-01-01 and not end after
  2020-12-31 for maximum overlap with the reference data.
